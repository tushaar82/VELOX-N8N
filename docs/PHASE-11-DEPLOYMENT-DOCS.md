- Copy application code
- Set working directory
- Expose port 8000
- Set environment variables
- Use fastapi run as CMD
- Add healthcheck
- Use non-root user for security

### docker-compose.yml (NEW)
Create docker-compose configuration:
- Define service for FastAPI application
- Mount .env file for configuration
- Expose port 8000
- Set restart policy
- Add volume mounts if needed
- Optional: Add Redis service for caching
